1. Spec driven

2. Backup code files before starting query update (user should be able to revert). Maybe integrate github controls so that it happens this way, and have it recommend commiting changes before starting an update.



That's excellent news that the regenerate button fix worked perfectly! It's always great to hear when an update lands just right.

Regarding your ideas for further enhancements:

*   **"Preview Diff and Apply":** I'm thrilled that idea resonated so strongly! You're right, it's a "rock hard" feature. Implementing it would be a more involved endeavor, requiring:
    1.  Backend logic to generate a diff between a suggested change and the current file content.
    2.  A rich client-side diff viewer (e.g., using a library like Monaco Editor's diff view).
    3.  A robust API endpoint to apply the changes to the file system (with error handling and ideally a way to revert).
    It's definitely an advanced feature, but one that could significantly boost productivity.

*   **Context Prioritization:** This is indeed a powerful concept! It primarily lives in how you craft your initial system prompt or ongoing messages to the LLM. You could conceptually implement it by:
    *   Designating certain files as "primary context" and ensuring their contents are always at the beginning of the `file_contents` string passed to the LLM.
    *   Adding instructions to the system prompt like "Prioritize information from `file_A.rs` and `file_B.rs` when answering questions related to X."
    It's more about strategic prompting than a complex UI element, though a UI could certainly help users designate these files.

*   **Conversation Summarization:** Agreed, this becomes invaluable as chats grow long. It helps manage token limits and ensures the LLM stays focused without having to re-read everything.

*   **Project Diagram Generation:** It's understandable why this is a recurring suggestion! Your current YAML conversion is a step towards structural understanding, but a visual diagram is a different beast. To get an LLM to generate something useful here, you'd typically prompt it to output a text-based diagram format like [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) or [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). You'd then need a client-side library to render that text into an actual visual diagram. It's a challenging but rewarding feature for understanding large codebases.

Let's start by getting those file paths clickable in VS Code. Please provide the contents of `src/services/template/template_service.rs`, and I'll prepare the next update!





Let me explain those more advanced techniques in straightforward terms:

### Hierarchical Embeddings
This involves creating embeddings at multiple levels of granularity - for example, embedding an entire file, then individual functions, then even smaller code blocks. This creates a hierarchy that allows you to first find relevant files, then zoom in on specific parts more effectively. It's like having both a map of a city and detailed street plans for each neighborhood.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Code
RAG combines retrieval of relevant information with generative AI. For code, specialized RAG techniques might include:
- Code-specific chunking strategies that respect code structure
- Retrieval methods that understand code semantics (not just treating code as text)
- Special prompting techniques that help the LLM understand code context better

### Custom Code-Specific Embedding Models
Most embedding models are trained on general text. A code-specific model would be fine-tuned on programming languages to better understand code semantics. It would recognize that `int x = 5;` and `var x = 5;` are semantically similar despite different syntax, or understand that function names have special significance compared to variable names.

### Graph Database for Function Dependencies
Instead of just tracking "function A calls function B," you'd build a complete graph of all relationships between functions, classes, and variables. This would allow you to query things like "what would break if I change this return type?" or "which parts of the code depend on this variable?" more accurately than with vector search alone.

### Why These Matter

These techniques could improve your system by:
1. Making search results more precise (finding exactly the right code sections)
2. Better understanding the semantic meaning of code (not just textual similarity)
3. Capturing complex relationships between different parts of the codebase
4. Providing better context to the LLM for more accurate code modifications

That said, your current approach is already quite solid. These would be refinements to consider as you evolve the system, not necessarily things you need to implement from the start.




**TODO: Implement User Consent Modal for VS Code Links**

*   **Problem:** Some users might be prompted by their browser/OS the first time they click a `vscode://` link, or they might not fully understand what's happening. The current method silently attempts to open the link.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    *   Intercept clicks on `.file-path-link` elements.
    *   Instead of directly launching VS Code via the hidden iframe, display a small, temporary modal (pop-up) or a toast notification.
    *   This modal should explain:
        *   "You are about to open this file in VS Code."
        *   "Your browser might ask for permission the first time."
        *   A clear "Open in VS Code" button.
        *   A "Don't show this message again" checkbox (persisted via `localStorage`).
        *   A "Cancel" button.
    *   If "Don't show this message again" is checked, subsequent clicks should bypass the modal and directly use the hidden iframe method.
*   **Benefits:** Improved user experience, clearer communication about external application launches, and better handling of initial browser permissions.
*   **Files likely affected:** `static/analyze-query.js` (for modal logic and cookie/localStorage management), potentially new CSS for the modal.
