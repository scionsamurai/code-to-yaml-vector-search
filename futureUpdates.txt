Let me explain those more advanced techniques in straightforward terms:

### Hierarchical Embeddings
This involves creating embeddings at multiple levels of granularity - for example, embedding an entire file, then individual functions, then even smaller code blocks. This creates a hierarchy that allows you to first find relevant files, then zoom in on specific parts more effectively. It's like having both a map of a city and detailed street plans for each neighborhood.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Code
RAG combines retrieval of relevant information with generative AI. For code, specialized RAG techniques might include:
- Code-specific chunking strategies that respect code structure
- Retrieval methods that understand code semantics (not just treating code as text)
- Special prompting techniques that help the LLM understand code context better

### Custom Code-Specific Embedding Models
Most embedding models are trained on general text. A code-specific model would be fine-tuned on programming languages to better understand code semantics. It would recognize that `int x = 5;` and `var x = 5;` are semantically similar despite different syntax, or understand that function names have special significance compared to variable names.

### Graph Database for Function Dependencies
Instead of just tracking "function A calls function B," you'd build a complete graph of all relationships between functions, classes, and variables. This would allow you to query things like "what would break if I change this return type?" or "which parts of the code depend on this variable?" more accurately than with vector search alone.

### Why These Matter

These techniques could improve your system by:
1. Making search results more precise (finding exactly the right code sections)
2. Better understanding the semantic meaning of code (not just textual similarity)
3. Capturing complex relationships between different parts of the codebase
4. Providing better context to the LLM for more accurate code modifications

That said, your current approach is already quite solid. These would be refinements to consider as you evolve the system, not necessarily things you need to implement from the start.
