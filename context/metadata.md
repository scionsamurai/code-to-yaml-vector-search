## 🧠 Phase 0: Context Setting

### ✅ Outline Details

* Gather basic metadata about the project
* Prime the AI to understand the project’s scope and goals

### 🧰 Prompt Template

'''plaintext
I am building a project called [PROJECT_NAME]. Its purpose is: “[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION].”

I want help planning it out step by step, including features, tech stack, design patterns, folder structure, and development phases. 
Are you ready to assist with this?
'''

### 🧭 Guidance

* This phase can be handled with a minimal form:

  * Project Name (text input)
  * One-line Description (text input)
  * Optional kickoff message or CTA like “Begin Planning”
* Store this context in memory or local storage to persist across steps
* Consider allowing “Load previous project” to skip ahead
