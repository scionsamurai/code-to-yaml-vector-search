To create universal guidelines for converting code from any language to YAML, we need to focus on the common features and structures that exist across programming languages. Here are the guidelines:

1. **File Metadata**: Include metadata about the file, such a brief description of the file's purpose or contents. Always include this at the top.

```yaml
---
description: This file contains utility functions for data processing.
```

2. **Function/Method Definitions**: For each function or method definition, include the name, parameters, return type (if applicable), and a brief description of its purpose.

```yaml
functions:
  - name: process_data
    parameters:
      - name: data
        type: list
        description: A list of data points to process
      - name: filter_threshold
        type: float
        description: The threshold value for filtering data
    return_type: list
    description: Filters and processes the input data based on the specified threshold.
```

3. **Class Definitions**: For each class definition, include the class name, inheritance information (if applicable), and a brief description of its purpose. Then, list the class methods and properties following the same guidelines as for functions.

```yaml
classes:
  - name: DataProcessor
    inherits: object
    description: A class for processing data.
    methods:
      # Method definitions here
    properties:
      # Property definitions here
```

4. **Type Annotations**: If the language supports type annotations, include them for variables, function parameters, and return values.

```yaml
variables:
  - name: data_filter
    type: Callable[[float], bool]
    description: A function that filters data based on a given threshold.
```

5. **Code Comments**: Include relevant code comments as descriptions for functions, classes, variables, and other code elements.

6. **Import Statements**: For languages that use import statements, include a list of imported modules or packages.

```yaml
imports:
  - module: numpy
    description: A library for numerical computing in Python.
  - module: pandas
    description: A library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
```

7. **Data Structures**: For complex data structures like dictionaries, lists, or custom objects, include their structure and a brief description of their purpose.

```yaml
data_structures:
  - name: person
    type: dict
    description: A dictionary representing a person's information.
    structure:
      name: str
      age: int
      contact:
        phone: str
        email: str
```

8. **Language-Specific Features**: If a particular language has unique features or constructs (e.g., decorators in Python, traits in Scala), include guidelines for representing them in the YAML representation.

These guidelines should provide a solid foundation for converting code from any language to a consistent YAML format. You can adjust and extend them as needed based on the specific requirements of your project and the languages involved.
